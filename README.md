## S3 bucket & objects
Q: acl vs public bucket policy vs access point policies
A: ACL (Access Control List), Public Bucket Policy, and Access Point Policies are different mechanisms in AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) that allow you to control access to your S3 buckets and objects. Here's a brief explanation of each:
ACL (Access Control List): ACLs are a legacy method of managing access to S3 buckets and objects. With ACLs, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or predefined groups (e.g., authenticated users, all users) at the bucket or object level. ACLs provide basic control over access but can become complex to manage as the number of users and resources increases.
Public Bucket Policy: A Public Bucket Policy is a JSON-based policy that allows you to define permissions for your S3 bucket and its objects. It provides more granular control than ACLs and allows you to specify rules for different types of access (e.g., read, write, list) to specific IP addresses, AWS accounts, or even anonymous users. Public Bucket Policies are commonly used to make specific buckets or objects publicly accessible.
Access Point Policies: Access Points are a feature in S3 that allow you to create unique entry points for accessing your bucket. Access Point Policies are JSON-based policies that are attached to an access point. They provide fine-grained control over access to the objects within the access point. Access Point Policies allow you to define permissions for specific AWS accounts or IAM roles, and you can also specify conditions for access (e.g., time-based access, IP address restrictions).
In summary, ACLs, Public Bucket Policies, and Access Point Policies are different mechanisms for controlling access to S3 buckets and objects. ACLs are a legacy method, while Public Bucket Policies and Access Point Policies provide more granular control and flexibility. Public Bucket Policies are used to make buckets or objects publicly accessible, while Access Point Policies are used to control access to objects through access points. It's recommended to use Public Bucket Policies or Access Point Policies for managing access to S3 resources, as they offer more advanced features and are easier to manage than ACLs.

Q: Explain Bucket Policy
A: A bucket policy attached directly to an S3 bucket in the s3 console.
It is a resource-based policy that allows you to define permissions for the bucket and its objects.
Bucket policies are written in JSON format.
Bucket policies are used to control access to the entire bucket or specific objects within the bucket.
You can grant permissions to AWS accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, or even anonymous users.
Bucket policies are commonly used to make buckets or objects publicly accessible, define cross-account access, or enforce specific access controls for the bucket.

Q: What's object writer
A: an object writer in the context of AWS S3 refers to the entity or component responsible for writing or uploading objects to an S3 bucket. It can be a person using the AWS Management Console, a user executing AWS CLI commands, an application using AWS SDKs, or a third-party tool or library.

Q: explain sse-s3 encryption & bucket key
A: SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3) is a feature provided by AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) that allows you to encrypt your data at rest in S3 buckets. When you enable SSE-S3 encryption, AWS automatically encrypts your objects before storing them in S3 and decrypts them when you retrieve them. at "REST" means it encrypt the data against unauthorized access / data breaches to the PHYSICAL storage device e.g. the solid-state drive.
Enabling SSE-S3 with a bucket key provides an additional layer of security by allowing you to use your own encryption key to protect your data in S3. It gives you more control over the encryption process and ensures that only you have access to the key used for encryption and decryption.

Q: s3 static website hosting
A:S3 static website hosting is a feature provided by AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) that allows you to host static websites directly from an S3 bucket. With this feature, you can serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static files to users over the internet.
Static Website: A static website consists of files that are served as-is to users without any server-side processing. These files typically include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static content.
Bucket Configuration: To host a static website in S3, you need to create an S3 bucket and configure it for static website hosting. You can specify the index document (e.g., index.html) and error document (e.g., error.html) that S3 should use when serving the website.
Website Endpoint: Once you configure the bucket for static website hosting, S3 provides you with a website endpoint URL. This URL can be used to access your static website over the internet.
Access Permissions: You can control access to your static website by configuring bucket policies, IAM policies, or Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the S3 bucket. You can make your website publicly accessible or restrict access to specific users or groups.
Custom Domain: By default, the website endpoint URL provided by S3 includes the bucket name (e.g., http://bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com). If you want to use your own custom domain (e.g., http://www.example.com), you can configure a DNS (Domain Name System) record to point to the S3 website endpoint.
HTTPS Support: S3 static website hosting supports HTTP by default. If you want to enable HTTPS for your website, you can use Amazon CloudFront in front of your S3 bucket to serve the website over HTTPS.
S3 static website hosting is a cost-effective and scalable solution for hosting static websites. It eliminates the need for managing and maintaining traditional web servers, making it easy to deploy and scale static websites quickly.

Q: virtual hosted style url vs a path style url
A: In AWS S3, there are two types of URLs that can be used to access S3 objects: virtual hosted style URLs and path style URLs. Virtual hosted style URLs are URLs that use the BUCKET NAME as part of the domain name in the URL. For example, a virtual hosted style URL for an S3 object might look like this: http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/myobject - Path style URLs, on the other hand, are URLs that use the bucket name as part of the PATH in the URL. For example, a path style URL for the same S3 object might look like this: http://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myobject - Virtual hosted style URLs are generally preferred over path style URLs, as they provide better performance and scalability. Virtual hosted style URLs allow S3 to distribute requests across multiple servers, which can improve performance and reduce latency. Path style URLs, on the other hand, require S3 to route all requests through a single server, which can limit performance and scalability.

## ec2 (elastic compute cloud) & VPC
Q: What are the uses of ec2
A: Web Applications: EC2 instances are commonly used to host web applications. You can deploy your web application on an EC2 instance and configure it to handle incoming web traffic. EC2 provides flexibility in terms of instance types, scalability, and load balancing to handle varying levels of web traffic.
Data Processing: EC2 instances can be used for data processing tasks such as data analytics, big data processing, and batch processing. You can launch instances with the required processing power and memory to perform complex data processing tasks efficiently.
Application Development and Testing: EC2 provides a scalable and cost-effective environment for application development and testing. You can create development and testing environments on EC2 instances, allowing developers to build, test, and debug applications before deploying them to production.
High-Performance Computing: EC2 instances can be used for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads that require significant computational power. EC2 offers instance types optimized for HPC, allowing you to run simulations, scientific calculations, and other compute-intensive tasks.
Content Delivery: EC2 instances can be used as origin servers for content delivery networks (CDNs). You can store and serve static content, such as images, videos, and files, from EC2 instances to improve the performance and availability of your content globally.
Databases: EC2 instances can be used to host databases, including relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra. EC2 provides the flexibility to choose the appropriate instance type and storage options for your database workload.
Machine Learning: EC2 instances can be used for training and deploying machine learning models. You can leverage the computational power of EC2 instances to train models on large datasets and then deploy the trained models for real-time predictions or inference.
These are just a few examples of the many use cases for EC2. The flexibility, scalability, and wide range of instance types offered by EC2 make it suitable for various computing tasks in the cloud.

Q: What storage types are avilable to use with ec2 instances
A: Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network-attached and can be used as primary storage for your EC2 instances. They offer durability, high availability, and the ability to persist data even after an instance is terminated. EBS volumes come in different types, including General Purpose SSD (gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), and Cold HDD (sc1), allowing you to choose the right performance and cost balance for your workload.
Instance Store: EC2 instances also have access to temporary block-level storage known as instance store. Instance store volumes are physically attached to the host server and provide high-performance, low-latency storage. However, the data stored on instance store volumes is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated. Instance store is ideal for temporary data, caching, and scratch space.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): While not directly attached to EC2 instances, you can use Amazon S3 as an object storage service to store and retrieve any amount of data. S3 is highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective. You can access S3 data from your EC2 instances over the network using the AWS SDKs or APIs.
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System): Amazon EFS provides a scalable and fully managed file storage service that can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. EFS supports the Network File System (NFS) protocol, allowing you to share files across multiple instances. It is suitable for use cases that require shared file storage, such as content management systems, web serving, and data analytics.
AWS Storage Gateway: AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage service that enables you to seamlessly integrate on-premises environments with AWS storage services. It provides different types of gateways, including file, volume, and tape gateways, allowing you to extend your on-premises storage to the cloud and access it from EC2 instances.

Q: what's ami?
A: AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It is a pre-configured template that contains the necessary information to launch an instance (virtual server) in Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). An AMI includes the operating system, software, and configuration settings required to start an instance.
Template for Instances: An AMI serves as a template or blueprint for launching instances in EC2. It encapsulates the root file system, launch permissions, and block device mappings.
Operating System and Software: An AMI includes the operating system (such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server, etc.) and any additional software or applications that are pre-installed on the instance. This allows you to quickly launch instances with the desired software stack.
Public and Private AMIs: AWS provides a wide range of public AMIs that are created and shared by the community or AWS itself. These AMIs are available for anyone to use. Additionally, you can create your own private AMIs, which are only accessible to your AWS account.
Customization and Configuration: You can customize and configure an instance launched from an AMI to meet your specific requirements. This includes modifying the instance type, storage, security groups, networking settings, and more.
Versioning and Updates: AMIs can be versioned, allowing you to keep track of different iterations or updates of the same AMI. This is useful for managing changes to the software stack or configuration over time.
Sharing and Marketplace: You can share your custom AMIs with other AWS accounts or make them publicly available. AWS also provides a marketplace where you can find and purchase pre-configured AMIs from third-party vendors.
Using AMIs, you can easily launch instances with the desired operating system, software, and configuration settings. This simplifies the process of provisioning and deploying new instances in EC2, saving time and effort in setting up and configuring each instance manually.

Q: instance type, memory, and storage resources
A: instance types determine the virtual server's specifications, including the amount of memory and storage resources available. 
Instance Types: EC2 offers a wide range of instance types, each optimized for different use cases and workloads. Instance types are categorized based on their intended use, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, GPU instances, and more. Each instance type has its own combination of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
Memory Resources: Memory resources refer to the amount of RAM (Random Access Memory) available in an EC2 instance. The memory capacity determines the amount of data that can be processed and stored in the instance's memory. EC2 instance types offer varying levels of memory capacity, ranging from a few gigabytes to several terabytes. For example, t2.micro instances have 1 GB of memory, while r5.24xlarge instances have 768 GB of memory.
Storage Resources:
Instance Store: Some EC2 instance types come with instance store volumes, which are temporary block-level storage directly attached to the host server. Instance store volumes provide high-performance, low-latency storage but are ephemeral, meaning the data stored on them is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated. The size and performance characteristics of instance store volumes vary depending on the instance type.
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Amazon EBS provides persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network-attached and offer durability and the ability to persist data even after an instance is terminated. The size and performance of EBS volumes depend on the specific EBS volume type chosen, such as General Purpose SSD (gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), or Cold HDD (sc1).
Ephemeral vs. Persistent Storage: It's important to note that instance store volumes are ephemeral, meaning they are temporary and do not persist beyond the life of the instance. On the other hand, EBS volumes provide persistent storage that can be detached from one instance and attached to another, allowing data to be retained even if the instance is terminated.
When selecting an EC2 instance type, you should consider the memory and storage requirements of your workload. Memory-intensive applications, such as databases or in-memory analytics, may benefit from instances with larger memory capacity. Workloads that require high-performance storage or data persistence may require the use of EBS volumes. Understanding your workload's memory and storage needs will help you choose the appropriate EC2 instance type and storage options.

Q: key pair
A: a key pair is a secure way to connect to your EC2 instances. It consists of a public key and a private key. Here's what you need to know about key pairs in EC2:

Public Key: The public key is used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. In EC2, the public key is associated with your EC2 instance and is used to authenticate your connection to the instance.
Private Key: The private key is a secret key that is securely stored on your local machine. It is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the associated public key. You must keep the private key secure and not share it with anyone.
Key Pair Creation: When you create an EC2 instance, you have the option to specify a key pair. If you don't have an existing key pair, you can create a new one using the EC2 Key Pair service. EC2 generates the key pair and provides you with the private key file to download. It's important to securely store the private key file on your local machine.
SSH Access: The key pair is primarily used for SSH (Secure Shell) access to your EC2 instances. When you connect to an EC2 instance using SSH, you provide the private key file as part of the authentication process. The EC2 instance verifies the private key against the associated public key stored on the instance, allowing you to establish a secure connection.
Key Pair Management: You can manage your key pairs in the EC2 console or through the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). You can create new key pairs, import existing ones, and associate them with your EC2 instances. It's important to keep track of your key pairs and ensure they are securely stored.
Using key pairs in EC2 provides a secure way to connect to your instances and protect your data. It's essential to properly manage and secure your private key to prevent unauthorized access to your EC2 instances.

Q: user data (optinal meta-data script)
A: User data is an optional meta data and used for various purposes such as installing and configuring software packages, running startup scripts or initialization tasks, setting up environment variables or system configurations, downloading and configuring application code, and customizing the instance based on specific requirements.
User data is provided as a script or a set of commands in plain text format. The script can be written in various scripting languages, such as Bash, PowerShell, or Python. The user data script is executed by the instance's operating system during the boot process.
User data can be passed to an EC2 instance during its launch using the EC2 console, AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), or SDKs (Software Development Kits). The user data can be entered directly or provided as a file. If the user data is provided as a file, it should be base64-encoded before passing it to the instance.
When an EC2 instance is launched with user data, the instance retrieves the user data script from the metadata service provided by EC2. The script is then executed by the instance's operating system. The execution of the user data script happens only once during the initial boot of the instance.
The EC2 instance metadata service allows an instance to retrieve information about itself, including the user data. The user data can be accessed from within the instance using the metadata service API or by querying specific metadata endpoints.
Here's an example of how to modify the user data of a stopped instance using the AWS CLI:
Encode the user data script using the appropriate command for your operating system:
On Linux: base64 my_script.txt > my_script_base64.txt
On Windows: certutil -encode my_script.txt my_script_base64.txt
Use the modify-instance-attribute command to modify the user data of the stopped instance:
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --attribute userData --value file://my_script_base64.txt
This command specifies the encoded text file as the user data for the instance using the --value parameter. The file:// prefix is used to specify the file.

Q: base64 encoding
A: When a script is encoded using Base64, it undergoes a process of conversion that transforms its content into a series of ASCII characters. Here's what happens when a script is encoded using Base64:
The script's content, which can be binary or text, is divided into a series of 3-byte chunks.
Each 3-byte chunk is converted into a 24-bit binary value.
The 24-bit binary value is split into four 6-bit chunks.
Each 6-bit chunk is mapped to a corresponding character from the Base64 character set, which consists of 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and '+' and '/'). The mapping is done based on the decimal value of the 6-bit chunk.
The resulting Base64 characters are concatenated to form the encoded representation of the script.
The encoded script is a string of ASCII characters that can be safely transmitted or stored without any loss of data. It can be used in various scenarios, such as passing user data to an EC2 instance in Amazon Web Services (AWS) or transmitting binary data over text-based protocols.
When the encoded script needs to be used, it can be decoded back into its original form using a Base64 decoding algorithm. The decoding process reverses the steps mentioned above, converting the Base64 characters back into their original binary representation.
Base64 encoding is commonly used to ensure that data can be safely transmitted or stored in systems that only support ASCII characters. It is widely used in applications that involve data exchange, such as email attachments, web APIs, and file transfers.

Q: instance connect vs session manager vs ssh vs serial console vs sdk vs cli
A: Instance Connect, Session Manager, SSH, Serial Console, SDK, and CLI are different methods and tools used for connecting to and managing Amazon EC2 instances.
Instance Connect: Instance Connect is a browser-based SSH connection method provided by AWS. It allows you to securely connect to your EC2 instances using the AWS Management Console without the need for a separate SSH client. Instance Connect uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication and supports SSH key pairs for secure access.
Session Manager: AWS Systems Manager Session Manager is a fully managed service that provides secure and auditable instance management for EC2 instances. It allows you to start interactive shell sessions or run commands on your instances without the need for SSH access. Session Manager uses IAM for authentication and supports fine-grained access control and session logging.
SSH: SSH (Secure Shell) is a widely used protocol for secure remote access to Unix-like systems, including EC2 instances. It provides encrypted communication between the client and the server, allowing you to securely log in to and manage your instances. SSH requires the use of SSH key pairs for authentication and supports various SSH clients, such as OpenSSH, PuTTY, and WinSCP.
Serial Console: The EC2 Serial Console provides a troubleshooting and recovery mechanism for EC2 instances. It allows you to access the system console of your instances, even if they are unreachable over the network or experiencing boot issues. The Serial Console provides a text-based interface for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
SDK: SDK (Software Development Kit) refers to the collection of libraries, tools, and documentation provided by AWS to interact with their services programmatically. AWS SDKs are available for various programming languages and provide APIs for managing EC2 instances, among other AWS services. SDKs allow you to automate tasks, integrate AWS services into your applications, and programmatically manage your EC2 instances.
CLI: CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool provided by AWS that allows you to interact with AWS services, including EC2, from the command line. The AWS CLI provides a set of commands and options for managing EC2 instances, such as launching instances, managing security groups, and executing commands on instances. It is a powerful tool for scripting and automating tasks.
Each of these methods and tools has its own advantages and use cases. The choice of which method to use depends on factors such as your preference, the level of control and security required, and the specific tasks you need to perform on your EC2 instances.

Q: public ipv4 VS private ipv4 VS ipv4 dns
A: Public IPv4 addresses are globally unique addresses used to identify devices on the internet, while private IPv4 addresses are used for internal network communication and are not accessible from the internet directly.
Public IPv4 addresses are managed and allocated by ISPs and IANA, while private IPv4 addresses are assigned by routers within local networks.
IPv4 DNS is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses. It enables devices to resolve domain names and connect to websites and services. It uses IPv4 addresses for mapping domain names to IP addresses and vice versa
Public IPv4:
Public IPv4 addresses are globally unique addresses assigned to devices connected to the internet. They are used to identify and communicate with devices over the internet.
Public IPv4 addresses are routable and can be accessed and reached from any other device connected to the internet.
Public IPv4 addresses are managed and allocated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
Examples of public IPv4 address ranges include: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 and 128.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255[0].
Public IPv4 addresses are necessary for devices to access the internet and communicate with other devices globally[3].
Private IPv4:
Private IPv4 addresses are used within a local network to allow devices to communicate with each other. They are not globally unique and cannot be directly accessed from the internet.
Private IPv4 addresses are typically assigned by the router within the local network using Network Address Translation (NAT). This allows multiple devices within the network to share a single public IPv4 address for internet access.
Private IPv4 addresses are defined in specific ranges reserved for private use, such as:
Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255[1].
Private IPv4 addresses are not accessible or routable from the internet. They are used for internal network communication and are commonly used in home, office, or enterprise networks[1][2].
IPv4 DNS:
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (such as example.com) into IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers can understand.
IPv4 DNS refers to the use of IPv4 addresses in the DNS system. It involves mapping domain names to corresponding IPv4 addresses and vice versa.
DNS servers maintain a database of domain name to IP address mappings, allowing devices to resolve domain names to their respective IP addresses.
The most commonly used IPv4 DNS server addresses are:
Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220[4].
IPv4 DNS is an essential component of internet communication, enabling devices to locate and connect to websites and services using domain names[4].

Q: nacl (network access control list)
A: netowrk acl is a firewall at the subnet level, aws creates a default acl for every subnet that is created which allows BY DEFAULT all inbound and all outbound traffic but you can create a custom nacl and attach/assoicate it to your subnet instead of the default one. you can attach multiple subnets to a NACL, but only 1 nacl can be attached to each subnet. * NACL are sorted by order where the lowest number of a rule <rule number> has the highest priority and if a rule is passed by the priority order the traffic will pass WITHOUT checking the other rules (only in nacl it's like this) and nacl are stateless and required specific rules for inbound and outbound traffic.

Q: security groups
A: Security groups in AWS are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances. They act as a virtual firewall for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. Each security group has rules that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. security groups are statefull and allows responses to inbound traffic automatically without the need to configure outbound traffic and same for vice versa. unlike NACL, in security groups all the rules are evulated indivudally before deciding whether to allow traffic in / out or not, traffic can be restricted by ip type (ssh,), protocol (tcp, http), port range (80, 443), traffic soucce (cidr-classless inter domain routes) example of using security groups: webserver instance allows inbound traffic from internet 0.0.0.0/0 for https port 443. the application instance allows http port 80 from the webserver instance only. the database instance allows inbound traffic on tcp port 3306 from application instance ip only. and remmeber secuirty groups are stateful so no need to configure outbound rules as it's automatically sent back. this creates very safety network as even if someone hacks the webserver and wants to steal data they still can't access the database directly. 
* security groups are NOT ACTIVE ubless they are assigned to an instance / resource (ec2 etc)
* the security groups you assoicate with your instances determines which traffic can access those instances / resources e.g. load balancers / your webserver etc. by using security group as the source type you don't need to specify speific addresses , so for example for the load balancer outbound you put the security group of the webservers and for inbound rule of the webservers you put the security group of the load balancers for "dobule" security.

Q: what's the difference between network acl and security groups? 
A: Network ACLs and Security Groups are both used to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from resources within a VPC in AWS. However, Network ACLs are stateless and applied at the subnet level, while Security Groups are stateful and applied at the instance level. Network ACLs are evaluated BEFORE Security Groups which means if there's a traffic that is blocked by NACL it won't reach the security group and you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic for a specific protocol and port with Network ACLs.

Q: what's a vpc?
A: VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It is a virtual network that you can create within your AWS account. A VPC allows you to provision and manage a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and more.
Isolation: A VPC provides network isolation, allowing you to create a private virtual network in the AWS cloud. This isolation ensures that your resources within the VPC are not accessible from the internet by default.
IP Addressing: When creating a VPC, you define the IP address range for the VPC using CIDR notation. This IP address range is then divided into subnets, which are smaller IP address ranges within the VPC.
Subnets: Subnets are subdivisions of a VPC and are associated with a specific availability zone (AZ) within an AWS region. You can create public subnets, which have a route to the internet, and private subnets, which do not have a direct route to the internet.
Routing: Each VPC has a default route table that controls the traffic flow between subnets within the VPC and between the VPC and other networks. You can also create custom route tables to define specific routing configurations for your VPC.
Security: VPCs provide built-in security features, such as security groups and network ACLs, to control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources. You can define rules to allow or deny traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses.
Connectivity: VPCs can be connected to your on-premises network using VPN (Virtual Private Network) or AWS Direct Connect, allowing you to extend your network into the AWS cloud.
Scalability: VPCs are highly scalable, allowing you to add or remove resources as needed. You can also create multiple VPCs within an AWS account to isolate different environments or applications.
By using VPCs, you can have full control over your network environment in AWS, including IP addressing, routing, and security. This enables you to build secure and scalable architectures for your applications and services.

Q: internet gateway - igw
A:An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scalable, highly available AWS service that allows communication between instances within your VPC and the internet. It serves as a gateway for internet-bound traffic to enter or leave your VPC.
Connectivity: An Internet Gateway provides a connection point between your VPC and the internet. It enables instances within your VPC to communicate with the internet and allows internet users to access resources within your VPC.
Public Subnets: To enable internet connectivity for instances within your VPC, you need to associate a public subnet with the Internet Gateway. A public subnet is a subnet that has a route to the Internet Gateway in its associated route table.
Routing: To route traffic to and from the internet, you need to configure the route table associated with your public subnet. Typically, you add a default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the Internet Gateway in the public subnet's route table. This directs all internet-bound traffic to the Internet Gateway.
Elastic IP Addresses: To allow inbound traffic from the internet to your instances, you can associate Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) with your instances. EIPs are static, public IP addresses that you can allocate and associate with your instances. This allows your instances to have a fixed public IP address even if they are stopped and restarted.
Security: Internet Gateways do not provide any inherent security. To control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances, you should use security groups and network ACLs. Security groups act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, while network ACLs act as stateless firewalls at the subnet level.
Data Transfer Costs: It's important to note that there may be data transfer costs associated with traffic going through the Internet Gateway. AWS provides free data transfer between EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone, but data transfer to and from the internet and between different Availability Zones may incur charges.
Internet Gateways are a crucial component for enabling internet connectivity in your VPC. They allow your instances to communicate with the internet and enable users to access your resources hosted within the VPC.

Q: nat gateway
A: A NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation Gateway) is a managed AWS service that allows instances within a private subnet in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to access the internet while keeping them hidden from the public internet.
Outbound Internet Access: NAT Gateways provide outbound internet access for instances in private subnets. They allow instances to initiate outbound connections to the internet, such as downloading software updates or accessing external services.
IP Address Translation: When an instance in a private subnet sends a request to the internet through a NAT Gateway, the NAT Gateway translates the private IP address of the instance to a public IP address. This allows the response from the internet to be routed back to the instance.
High Availability: NAT Gateways are highly available and automatically scale to handle increased traffic. AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, ensuring high availability and reliability.
Elastic IP Address: To use a NAT Gateway, you need to allocate an Elastic IP address (EIP) and associate it with the NAT Gateway. The EIP serves as the public IP address for the instances in the private subnet when they communicate with the internet.
Security: NAT Gateways act as a barrier between instances in private subnets and the public internet. They provide an additional layer of security by hiding the private IP addresses of instances from the internet, reducing the attack surface.
Data Transfer Costs: It's important to note that there may be data transfer costs associated with traffic going through a NAT Gateway. AWS charges for data transfer out of the VPC, including traffic routed through a NAT Gateway.
NAT Gateways are commonly used in scenarios where instances in private subnets require outbound internet access but do not need to be directly accessible from the internet. They provide a secure and scalable solution for internet connectivity in private subnets.
It's worth mentioning that for scenarios where you need inbound access to instances in private subnets, you can use a combination of a NAT Gateway for outbound traffic and a bastion host or a VPN connection for inbound access.

Q: vpc peering & how to creae it
A: vpc peering connects different vpcs to each other either on the same aws account or accross different aws accounts. peering provides sharing data transfer between different vpc's. 
A: 1. you have to add to the route table of the requester and receiver vpc their corresponding cidr block.
2. go to insatnces menu column -> security tab -> click on security groups option. inside inbound rules tab click edit inbound rules -> add in the type custom icmp-ipv4 and in the source the CIDR of the peered vpc subnet. if you need to add different traffic types you need to change the security group accordingly.
* peered VPCs do not necessairly accept all data between them by default. Security features, such as network access control lists and security groups, still apply. Be sure to update them accordingly as well.
* remmeber security groups are stateful which means the response for the request will be allowed to flow from the outbound reciever and into the inbound sender REGARDLESS if there are security groups rules that allows it!
* only a direct connection between peers exists (if both VPC A & C connects to VPC B via peering, A and C CANNOT communicate with each other - this is also called tranitive or edge to edge routing) 

Q: are all subnets in a vpc must share the same route table , security groups and acl?
A: No, all subnets in a VPC do not have to share the same route table, security groups, and network ACL (Access Control List). Each subnet in a VPC can have its own unique set of these resources.
Route Table: A route table controls the traffic flow between subnets within a VPC and between the VPC and other networks. By default, all subnets in a VPC are associated with the main route table. However, you can create additional custom route tables and associate specific subnets with them. This allows you to have different routing configurations for different subnets within the same VPC.
Security Groups: Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for instances within a VPC. Each instance can be associated with one or more security groups. You can define different security group rules for different subnets or instances within the same VPC. This allows you to have granular control over the network traffic for each subnet or instance.
Network ACL: Network ACLs are stateless, subnet-level firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. Each subnet in a VPC is associated with a network ACL. You can create multiple network ACLs and associate different subnets with different ACLs. This allows you to have different sets of rules for different subnets within the same VPC.
By having the flexibility to configure different route tables, security groups, and network ACLs for each subnet, you can customize the network traffic control and security settings based on the specific requirements of your applications and resources.
It's important to note that while subnets can have different route tables, security groups, and network ACLs, they must all be within the same VPC and have non-overlapping IP address ranges.

Q: how to attach a security group and a route table to a subnet
A: To attach a security group and a route table to a subnet in AWS, you can follow these steps:
Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
In the navigation pane, choose "Subnets" under the "Virtual Private Cloud" section.
Select the subnet to which you want to attach the security group and route table.
In the "Details" tab, scroll down to the "Network interfaces" section and click on the network interface ID.
In the network interface details page, click on the "Actions" button and choose "Change Security Groups".
In the "Change Security Groups" dialog box, select the security group(s) that you want to attach to the subnet. You can choose one or more security groups.
Click on the "Save" button to attach the selected security group(s) to the subnet.
To attach a route table to the subnet, go back to the subnet details page and click on the "Route Table" tab.
Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Route Table" field.
In the "Edit Route Table Association" dialog box, select the desired route table from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Save" button to attach the selected route table to the subnet.
Once the security group and route table are attached to the subnet, the associated rules and routes will take effect for the instances within that subnet.
It's important to note that a subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but it can be associated with multiple security groups.

Q: how to create a public subnet & private subnet
A: To create a private subnet and a public subnet in AWS, you can follow these steps:
1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose "Subnets" under the "Virtual Private Cloud" section.
3. Click on the "Create subnet" button.
4. Creating a Private Subnet: 4. In the "Create subnet" wizard, provide a name for the subnet and select the VPC in which you want to create the subnet.
5. Choose the availability zone (AZ) in which you want to create the subnet.
6. Specify the IP address range for the subnet by providing the IPv4 CIDR block. Make sure the CIDR block does not overlap with any other subnets in the VPC.
Leave the "Auto-assign IPv6 CIDR block" option unchecked for a private subnet.
Choose an existing route table or create a new one for the private subnet. This route table should not have a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) for outbound internet access.
Click on the "Create" button to create the private subnet.
Creating a Public Subnet: 
Follow steps 4-6 as mentioned above.
Enable the "Auto-assign IPv6 CIDR block" option if you want to assign an IPv6 CIDR block to the public subnet.
Choose an existing route table or create a new one for the public subnet. This route table should have a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) for outbound internet access.
Click on the "Create" button to create the public subnet.
After creating the subnets, you can launch instances in the respective subnets. Instances in the public subnet will have a public IP address and can communicate with the internet, while instances in the private subnet will have only private IP addresses and cannot directly access the internet.
Remember to configure the necessary security groups, network ACLs, and route tables to control the traffic flow and access between the subnets and the internet.

Q: Does an ec2 resides within a subnet?
A: Yes, an ec2 resides within a subnet, subnet is a range of ip addresses in your vpc.

Q: are security groups on the vpc level and on ec2 / instance level are the same ?
A: Yes, in aws, Security Groups are only applied at the instance level and are the same security groups showing at the vpc console.

Q: how to access inbound traffic in private subnet aws
A: To access inbound traffic in a private subnet in AWS, you can use a combination of a NAT Gateway and a bastion host or a VPN connection. Here are two common approaches:
Using a Bastion Host:
Deploy a bastion host in a public subnet. This bastion host acts as a secure gateway to access resources in the private subnet.
Configure the security group of the bastion host to allow inbound SSH (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows) connections from your IP address or a specific range of IP addresses.
Connect to the bastion host using SSH or RDP from your local machine.
Once connected to the bastion host, you can then use it as a jump server to access resources within the private subnet. For example, you can SSH into other instances in the private subnet from the bastion host.
Using a VPN Connection:
Set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your on-premises network and the VPC where the private subnet resides.
Configure the VPN connection to establish a secure tunnel between your on-premises network and the VPC.
Once the VPN connection is established, you can access resources within the private subnet as if they were part of your on-premises network. This allows inbound traffic from your on-premises network to reach the instances in the private subnet.
Both approaches provide secure access to resources in a private subnet. The choice between using a bastion host or a VPN connection depends on your specific requirements and network setup.
It's important to note that when setting up access to inbound traffic in a private subnet, you should follow security best practices, such as using strong authentication mechanisms, regularly updating and patching systems, and implementing appropriate network security controls.
* you can connect to a private subnet via the public subnet and send the response from the private subnet to the public and then back to the internet WITHOUT allowing direct access to the private subnet thereof those 2 methods above are only required if you need a DIRECT connection to the private subnet.

## RDS & DynamoDB (NOSql)
Q: failover
A: To implement failover (when a db becomes offline and a new one repalce it automatically) for an Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) instance, you can use the Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) feature provided by AWS. Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability and automatic failover support for RDS instances.
Multi-AZ Deployment: When you create an RDS instance, you can choose the Multi-AZ deployment option. This option creates a standby replica of your primary database in a different Availability Zone within the same AWS Region.
Synchronous Replication: The primary database and the standby replica are kept in sync through synchronous replication. Any changes made to the primary database are automatically replicated to the standby replica.
Automatic Failover: In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of the primary database, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the standby replica. The failover process involves promoting the standby replica to become the new primary database.
DNS Update: During the failover process, the DNS (Domain Name System) record associated with the RDS instance is updated to point to the new primary database. This ensures that client applications can seamlessly connect to the new primary database without any manual intervention.
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The time it takes for the failover to complete and the new primary database to become available depends on various factors, such as the size of the database and the amount of data to be synchronized. Amazon RDS aims to achieve a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 60 seconds for Multi-AZ failovers.
It's important to note that Multi-AZ deployment is available for certain database engines supported by Amazon RDS, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. However, it's not available for all database engine versions or instance classes. You should refer to the AWS documentation for specific details on Multi-AZ support for your chosen database engine and instance type.
By using Multi-AZ deployment, you can ensure high availability and automatic failover for your RDS instances, minimizing downtime and providing a reliable database solution.

Q: DynamoDB 
A: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to provide fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Here are some key points about DynamoDB:
NoSQL Database: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use the traditional relational database model with tables, rows, and columns. Instead, it uses a key-value store model with flexible schema design.
Fully Managed: DynamoDB is a fully managed service, which means AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure, such as hardware provisioning, software patching, and database administration tasks. This allows you to focus on developing your applications rather than managing the database infrastructure.
Scalability: DynamoDB is designed to scale horizontally to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads. It automatically partitions data across multiple servers to provide consistent performance as the workload increases. You can scale up or down the capacity of your DynamoDB tables based on your application's needs.
Performance: DynamoDB offers low-latency read and write operations, making it suitable for applications that require fast response times. It uses SSD storage to provide high-performance access to data.
Flexible Data Model: DynamoDB allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data, from a few kilobytes to terabytes, without sacrificing performance. It supports both simple key-value access and more complex data structures like lists, maps, and sets.
Strong Consistency or Eventual Consistency: DynamoDB provides two consistency models for read operations. You can choose between strong consistency, which ensures that all replicas have the most up-to-date data, or eventual consistency, which allows for lower latency but may return slightly stale data.
Security and Encryption: DynamoDB provides built-in security features, including encryption at rest and in transit. You can also control access to your DynamoDB tables using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and fine-grained access control using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
Integration with AWS Services: DynamoDB integrates well with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon Redshift, allowing you to build scalable and flexible applications using a combination of services.
DynamoDB is commonly used for various use cases, including web and mobile applications, gaming, IoT, and real-time analytics. It offers a highly available and scalable database solution with low latency and flexible data modeling capabilities.

Q: sql vs nosql & schema vs schemaless
A: the terms "schema" and "schemaless" refer to the way data is organized and structured within a database management system. Here's how schema and schemaless differ in SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL Databases (Schema):
Structure: SQL databases have a structured data model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Each table has a fixed set of columns and data types, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.
Schema Definition: In SQL databases, the schema defines the structure of the data, including the table names, column names, data types, constraints, and relationships. The schema must be defined before data can be inserted into the tables.
Data Validation: SQL databases enforce data validation based on the defined schema. Data inserted into the tables must conform to the specified data types and constraints defined in the schema.
Data Integrity: SQL databases ensure data integrity by enforcing referential integrity constraints and maintaining consistency between related tables.
Schema Evolution: Modifying the schema in SQL databases requires altering the table structure, which can involve adding or removing columns, changing data types, or modifying relationships. Schema changes may require downtime or data migration.
NoSQL Databases (Schemaless):
Structure: NoSQL databases have a flexible data model, allowing for unstructured or semi-structured data. They can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graph structures.
Schema Definition: NoSQL databases are often referred to as "schemaless" because they do not enforce a rigid schema. The structure of the data can evolve over time without requiring predefined schemas or table structures.
Dynamic Schema: In NoSQL databases, the schema is typically defined implicitly by the data itself. Each document or record can have its own structure, and different documents within the same collection can have different sets of fields.
Data Flexibility: NoSQL databases allow for easy addition or removal of fields within documents without requiring schema modifications. This flexibility is beneficial for applications that deal with rapidly changing or unstructured data.
Data Validation: While NoSQL databases do not enforce strict schema validation, they may provide some level of data validation through optional schema validation rules or application-level checks.
Schema Evolution: NoSQL databases handle schema evolution more seamlessly compared to SQL databases. New fields can be added to documents without affecting existing documents, and applications can adapt to the changes dynamically.
It's important to note that the terms "schema" and "schemaless" are used relatively and do not imply that SQL databases have no flexibility or that NoSQL databases have no structure. SQL databases provide a structured approach to data modeling, while NoSQL databases offer more flexibility in terms of data structure and schema evolution.
The choice between a schema-based SQL database and a schemaless NoSQL database depends on the specific requirements of your application, the nature of the data, and the need for flexibility or data consistency.

Q: map vs list in dynamodb attributes
A: Maps are useful for storing structured data that can be accessed by a UNIQUE key in the map (key: value, key2: value), while lists are useful for storing unstructured data that can be accessed by position (list[0],list[1] etc).

## EFS (elastic file system)
Q: what's the purpose of efs?
A: efs used to provides a serverless (no infrastrcutre setup / maintainance) elastic (scale up/down automatically according to your files size) file system that you can use to share files data without provisioning or managing storage.

Q: How to configure efs and connect it to ec2 instances?
A: 1. first you need to create a security group rule that allows NFS INBOUND TRAFFIC to the current security group that is attached to your instances that you want to allow efs there, this is required so instances can connect to the efs. to do so, go to the the securtiy group tab inside ec2 or vpc console then go to inbound rules tab and choose choose: "nfs" as the type, in the source choose the security group that your ec2 instaces are ALREADY attached to, this will give the instance an acccess to the shared file system you'll create and mount in the next steps.
2. go to efs console and create an efs and choose the customize option, choose the correct vpc your instances are in, the subnet id and the security group (that you have just created with the inbound rule) for each az you have create a sepereate mount target. (each mount target installs an elastic network interface (eni) into the chosen subnet). an eni is a glogical networking component in a vac that repenests a virtual network card. the eni atuaiotmcailly receives an ip address from the vpc.
3. go inside the efs you've just created and click the attach button. in the mount via dns tab copy the mount helper code. (you need to install later in session manager the package amazon-efs-utils to use this code) which shortcut the mount configuration and installation on each instance.
4. go to ec2 console choose the instance , click connect icon on top and choose the session manager tab. apply admin privilages by typing: sudo -i , install the amazon helper package (if you don't install it the bash terminal won't know what is the efs mount file type that you'll run after installing the package) by typing: sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils , then create folder: mkdir data, mount the fs there by typing: sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-XXXXXXX:/ DIR-NAME, go inside the directory you've mounted the fs into by typing: cd DIR-NAME, to create a continuos appending to a file (using -c flag) type: bash -c "cat >> efs-1-setup.log", then to actually append the data type the data you want e.g.: efs-1 mounted in site **, to view the content of the file type: cat efs-1-setup.log
5. go to another ec2 instance you want to add efs to, and repeat step 4 (and 3 if you've not mounted a file target in the efs) so you can access the fs that you've mounted in another az.

Q: amazon-efs-utils package
A: The amazon-efs-utils package is a set of tools provided by Amazon for working with Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). It includes the EFS mount helper, which simplifies the process of mounting EFS file systems on EC2 instances running supported Linux distribution.

Q: what is a file system?
A: A file system is a method or structure used by operating systems to organize and store data on storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), or network-attached storage (NAS) devices. It provides a way to manage and access files and directories stored on the storage medium.
A file system defines how data is organized, stored, and retrieved. It includes structures and algorithms for managing file metadata (such as file names, permissions, and timestamps) and data blocks that store the actual file content. The file system also handles tasks such as file allocation, disk space management, and file access control.
File systems can vary depending on the operating system and the storage medium being used. Some common file systems include:
FAT (File Allocation Table): Used by older versions of Windows and some removable storage devices. It has limitations on file size and partition size.
NTFS (New Technology File System): Used by modern versions of Windows. It supports larger file sizes, better security features, and more advanced file system features.
ext4 (Fourth Extended File System): Used by many Linux distributions. It is a journaled file system that provides improved performance and reliability compared to earlier versions of the ext file system.
HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus): Used by older versions of macOS. It has been replaced by the APFS (Apple File System) in newer macOS versions.
APFS (Apple File System): Used by newer versions of macOS and iOS. It is optimized for flash storage and provides features like snapshots, cloning, and encryption.
NTFS and exFAT: File systems commonly used for external storage devices like USB drives and SD cards. exFAT is designed to be compatible with both Windows and macOS.
Each file system has its own features, limitations, and compatibility with different operating systems. The choice of file system depends on factors such as the operating system being used, the storage medium, the desired features, and the intended use case.
It's important to note that file systems are an integral part of the operating system and are responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data. They play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity, security, and efficiency of file operations on a computer system.

Q: what is mount and what mount targets do in efs?
A: In the context of Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), "mount" refers to the process of making an EFS file system accessible and usable on an EC2 instance or on-premises server. Mounting an EFS file system allows you to access and work with the files and directories stored within it.
When you mount an EFS file system, it becomes available as a directory within the file system hierarchy of the operating system. This means that you can interact with the files and directories in the EFS file system just like you would with any other local directory on your system.
Mount targets, on the other hand, are the endpoints through which an EFS file system is made accessible to EC2 instances or on-premises servers. Each EFS file system can have one or more mount targets associated with it.
Mount targets are created within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets. They provide network connectivity between the EC2 instances or on-premises servers and the EFS file system. When you mount an EFS file system on an EC2 instance or on-premises server, you specify the mount target's IP address or DNS name to establish the connection.
The mount target handles the network traffic between the EC2 instance or on-premises server and the EFS file system. It ensures that the data is transferred securely and efficiently over the network. The mount target also handles tasks such as load balancing and fault tolerance, allowing multiple EC2 instances or on-premises servers to access the EFS file system simultaneously.
Mount targets are associated with specific subnets within a VPC. This allows you to control the network access to the EFS file system by configuring the security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) associated with the subnets.
In summary, mounting an EFS file system allows you to access and work with the files and directories stored within it, while mount targets provide the network connectivity and handle the communication between the EC2 instances or on-premises servers and the EFS file system.
* you can create mount target for a file system by using either the aws management console (aws website) , aws cli, or by programmatically using the aws sdks

Q: efs purposes?
A: EFS is used for a variety of use cases, such as: 
Content management: EFS can be used to store and manage content, such as images, videos, and documents, for use in web applications or other types of content management systems.
Big data analytics: EFS can be used to store and process large amounts of data for use in big data analytics applications, such as Hadoop or Spark.
Application development: EFS can be used to store and share code and other development assets across multiple EC2 instances, making it easier to develop and deploy applications.
Media processing: EFS can be used to store and process media files, such as audio and video, for use in media processing applications, such as transcoding or streaming.
Backup and disaster recovery: EFS can be used as a backup and disaster recovery solution, providing a scalable and highly available storage solution for critical data.

Q: ENI
A: In the context of Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is used to establish network connectivity between EC2 instances and the EFS file system.
When you mount an EFS file system on an EC2 instance, you need to ensure that the instance has network connectivity to the EFS service. This is where ENIs come into play.
To use EFS with an EC2 instance, you typically follow these steps:
Create an EC2 instance: Launch an EC2 instance in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where you want to use EFS.
Configure security groups: Ensure that the security groups associated with the EC2 instance allow inbound and outbound traffic for the necessary ports and protocols required for EFS communication.
Create an ENI: Create an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in the same subnet as the EC2 instance. This ENI will act as the network interface for the EC2 instance to connect to the EFS file system.
Attach the ENI to the EC2 instance: Attach the ENI to the EC2 instance using the EC2 console or AWS CLI. This establishes the network connectivity between the EC2 instance and the EFS file system.
Mount the EFS file system: Finally, mount the EFS file system on the EC2 instance using the mount command or by updating the /etc/fstab file. This allows the EC2 instance to access and use the files stored in the EFS file system.
By using an ENI, you can ensure that the EC2 instance has the necessary network connectivity to communicate with the EFS service and access the files stored in the EFS file system. The ENI acts as the bridge between the EC2 instance and the EFS service, enabling data transfer and file system operations.

Q: how to mount efs on an ec2 instance?
A: connect to the instance via ssh or session manager write:
sudo -i 
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
now you create a data directory, mount your Amazon EFS file system to the data directory, add entries to the existing log file, and view them by:
cd ~/
mkdir data
ls 
paste the sudo mount command that you copied from the Amazon EFS console in an earlier step. At the end of the command, replace the "efs" folder name with "data" (without quotes) and press Enter
cd data
sudo bash -c "cat >> efs-1-setup.log"
this is an ec2 in az B
cat efs-1-setup.log
You have successfully mounted an Amazon EFS file system to two Amazon EC2 instance
* can use amazon ec2 user data (optional meta data setting) to attach files systems to new instances everytime they lunch by pasting this code inside the user data 

## Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Groups
Q: what are the purpose and capabilities of auto scaling and load balancing
A: Auto Scaling:
Purpose:
Auto Scaling is designed to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your application in response to traffic patterns. This means that you can ensure that you have the right number of EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.
Capabilities:
Dynamic Scaling: Auto Scaling can increase the number of EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance, and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs.
Predictive Scaling: Auto Scaling uses machine learning algorithms to predict future traffic patterns and proactively scale your applications in anticipation of changes in traffic.
Health Checks: Auto Scaling continuously monitors the health of your instances. If an instance becomes unhealthy, Auto Scaling can replace it with a new one.
Balanced Across Availability Zones: Auto Scaling can ensure that your instances are evenly distributed across multiple Availability Zones in a region for high availability.
Load Balancing:
Purpose:
Load Balancing is used to distribute incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in multiple Availability Zones.
Capabilities:
Distribute Traffic: Load Balancing efficiently distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets.
Fault Tolerance: If a target becomes unavailable, Load Balancing automatically reroutes traffic to other healthy targets.
Health Checks: Load Balancing continuously checks the health of your targets and only sends traffic to the healthy ones.
SSL/TLS Termination: Load Balancers can handle SSL/TLS termination, offloading the work from your servers and freeing up resources on your backend.
Sticky Sessions: Load Balancers can bind a user's session to a specific target, enabling the user to connect to the same target for the duration of their session.
Together, Auto Scaling and Load Balancing can help you build highly available, fault-tolerant applications that can scale up or down based on demand, and distribute traffic efficiently across multiple targets.

Q: auto scaling group
A: An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is a key component of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Auto Scaling. It is a logical grouping of EC2 instances that are managed collectively to automatically scale in and out based on predefined policies and metrics. The purpose of an Auto Scaling Group is to ensure that you have the right number of instances available to handle the workload efficiently, while also providing high availability and fault tolerance. Here are some important aspects and capabilities of an Auto Scaling Group: Scaling Policies: An Auto Scaling Group allows you to define scaling policies that determine when and how the group should scale. Scaling policies can be based on various metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or application-specific metrics. You can define both scaling out (adding instances) and scaling in (removing instances) policies.
Dynamic Scaling: Auto Scaling Groups can automatically scale the number of instances based on the defined scaling policies and the current workload. This ensures that your application can handle increased traffic or demand without manual intervention. It also allows for efficient resource utilization by scaling in when the workload decreases.
Health Monitoring: Auto Scaling Groups continuously monitor the health of instances within the group. If an instance becomes unhealthy or fails, the Auto Scaling Group can automatically replace it with a new instance to maintain the desired capacity and availability.
Integration with Load Balancers: Auto Scaling Groups can be associated with Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) to distribute incoming traffic across the instances in the group. This helps to evenly distribute the workload and ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Integration with Launch Configurations: Auto Scaling Groups are associated with Launch Configurations, which define the configuration details for the instances launched by the group. This includes the AMI, instance type, security groups, and other settings. When scaling out, the Auto Scaling Group uses the Launch Configuration to launch new instances.
Integration with other AWS Services: Auto Scaling Groups can integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch, to monitor and collect metrics for scaling decisions. They can also be used in conjunction with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, and other services to automate the deployment and management of applications.
By using Auto Scaling Groups, you can ensure that your application can handle varying workloads efficiently, automatically scale in and out based on demand, and maintain high availability and fault tolerance. This helps optimize resource utilization, reduce costs, and improve the overall performance and reliability of your applications.

Q: how come that i send a load balancer traffic in ec2 to a public subnet but in the auto scaling group i configure to create only private subnet instances and it still connects just fine to the instances via the web?
A: In AWS, when you configure a load balancer to send traffic to instances in a public subnet, it is still possible to have the instances themselves located in private subnets. This is achieved through the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways or NAT instances.
Here's how it works:
Load Balancer in a Public Subnet: The load balancer is placed in a public subnet, which has a route table associated with it that has an internet gateway attached. This allows the load balancer to have a public IP address and be accessible from the internet.
Instances in Private Subnets: The instances that the load balancer routes traffic to can be located in private subnets. Private subnets do not have a direct internet gateway attached, so they are not directly accessible from the internet.
Network Address Translation (NAT): To allow the instances in the private subnets to communicate with the internet, you can use a NAT gateway or a NAT instance. The NAT gateway/instance acts as an intermediary between the private instances and the internet. It translates the private IP addresses of the instances to a public IP address, allowing them to communicate with the internet.
Routing: The route tables associated with the private subnets are configured to route outbound traffic to the NAT gateway/instance. This ensures that the instances can send traffic to the internet through the NAT gateway/instance.
When the load balancer receives traffic from the internet, it routes the traffic to the instances in the private subnets. The instances respond to the traffic, and the response is sent back to the load balancer through the NAT gateway/instance. The load balancer then forwards the response back to the client.
This setup allows you to have a secure architecture where your instances are located in private subnets, while still being able to receive traffic from the internet through the load balancer.
It's important to note that the instances in the private subnets do not have direct public IP addresses. They communicate with the internet through the NAT gateway/instance, which handles the translation of IP addresses.
* if you termiante an instance within an auto scaling group, which resutls in loweering the number of running instances below the auto scaling minimum requierment, a new isntance is launched autoamtically.
* to take advtange of the safety and reliability of geographic redundancy, span your auto scaling group accross multiple AZ and attach a load balacner to distribute incoming traffic across those az.
* by creating security group that allow inbound traffic from the internet to the load balancer and outbound to the security group of the webservers (and configure inbound traffic in the webservers to only allow load balancer traffic) you can run the instances in a private subnets inside the auto scaling group and they will still be accessible via the load balancer to the internet.


## IAM (Identity and access management)
Q: What's object reference
A: an object reference refers to a way of identifying and granting permissions to AWS resources or actions. IAM uses Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) as object references to uniquely identify resources within AWS.
An ARN is a string that follows a specific format and includes information about the AWS account, the resource type, and the resource name. It provides a standardized way to reference and manage resources across AWS services.
For example, an ARN for an IAM user might look like this:
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/my-iam-user
In this ARN, "123456789012" represents the AWS account ID, and "my-iam-user" is the name of the IAM user.
Object references are used in IAM policies to specify the resources or actions to which the policy applies. IAM policies define permissions and access control rules for users, groups, or roles within an AWS account. By referencing specific ARNs in IAM policies, you can grant or deny permissions to specific resources or actions.
For example, a policy statement might include an object reference to allow a specific IAM user to access an S3 bucket:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/my-iam-user"
  }
}
In this policy statement, the "Resource" field specifies the ARN of the S3 bucket, and the "Principal" field specifies the ARN of the IAM user.
By using object references in IAM policies, you can control access to AWS resources and actions based on specific identities or resource ARNs, providing granular control over permissions within your AWS environment.

Q: explain the difference betweem root user & IAM user
A: the root user is the initial user account that is created when you first create an AWS account. The root user has full access to all AWS services and resources in the account, and can perform any action on those resources. As such, it is recommended that you do not use the root user for day-to-day activities, but instead create and use IAM (Identity and Access Management) users. IAM users are separate user accounts that you can create and manage within your AWS ROOT account. IAM users have specific permissions that you can control and manage, allowing you to grant or restrict access to AWS services and resources as needed. IAM users can be assigned to groups, which can simplify the process of managing permissions for multiple users. this provides improved security (limit scope to your resources), accountability (track and audit actions taken by individual users), management (can control access of all users to every resource from one account

## General
Q: explain serverless
A: serverless refers to a model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically scales resources based on demand. In a serverless model, the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, operating systems, updates and network resources, and provides a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, where you can scale up or down your app resouces, pay per what you use only and focus on the code without managing the infrastrcture as well.

Q: What's cache and how is it useful in databases, servers and websites to improve performance?
A: Cache is a temporary storage location that stores frequently accessed data or computations in order to improve the performance of systems such as databases, servers, and websites. It acts as a high-speed data storage layer that sits between the data source and the requester, allowing for faster access to data.
Databases:
Query Results: In database systems, cache can store the results of frequently executed queries. When the same query is requested again, the database can retrieve the results from the cache instead of executing the query again, resulting in faster response times.
Data Objects: Cache can also store frequently accessed data objects, such as user profiles or product information. This reduces the need to fetch the data from the underlying database, improving overall database performance.
Servers:
Web Content: In web servers, cache can store static or dynamic content, such as HTML pages, images, or API responses. When a user requests the same content, the server can serve it directly from the cache, reducing the load on the server and improving response times.
Session Data: Cache can be used to store session data, such as user authentication tokens or session variables. This eliminates the need to query a database or perform expensive computations for each request, resulting in faster processing times.
Websites:
Page Caching: In websites, cache can store the rendered HTML pages. When a user requests a page, the server can serve the cached version instead of generating the page from scratch, leading to faster page load times.
Content Delivery: Cache can be used in content delivery networks (CDNs) to store and serve static assets, such as images, CSS files, or JavaScript files. This reduces the load on the origin server and improves the delivery speed for users located far from the server.
The benefits of using cache include reduced latency, improved response times, and increased scalability. By storing frequently accessed data or computations closer to the requester, cache minimizes the need for expensive operations, such as disk reads or database queries. This results in faster access to data and improved overall system performance.

Q: tags
A: In Amazon Web Services (AWS), tags are key-value pairs that you can assign to AWS resources. They are metadata that provide additional information about the resources, allowing you to categorize, organize, and manage them more effectively. Here are some key points about tags in AWS:
Purpose of Tags:
Categorization: Tags help you categorize and organize your AWS resources based on different criteria, such as environment (production, development), department, project, or cost center.
Resource Management: Tags enable you to easily identify and track resources, making it easier to manage and monitor them.
Cost Allocation: Tags can be used for cost allocation purposes, allowing you to track and analyze resource costs based on different tags.
Tag Structure:
Key-Value Pairs: Tags consist of a key and a corresponding value. The key is a user-defined label, and the value provides additional information associated with the key.
Case-Sensitive: Tags are case-sensitive, so "Environment" and "environment" would be considered as different tags.
Tagging AWS Resources:
Supported Resources: Tags can be assigned to a wide range of AWS resources, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, Lambda functions, and many others.
Tagging Methods: You can assign tags to resources using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or through infrastructure-as-code tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS Terraform.
Tag-Based Operations:
Resource Filtering: Tags can be used to filter and search for resources based on specific criteria. For example, you can find all resources with a specific tag key-value pair or resources with a specific tag key.
Resource Permissions: Tags can be used in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to resources based on specific tags. This allows you to grant or restrict access to resources based on their tags.
Cost Allocation Tags:
Cost Allocation Reports: Tags can be used to generate cost allocation reports in AWS Cost Explorer. By assigning tags to resources, you can analyze and allocate costs based on different tags, helping you understand and optimize your AWS spending.
Tags provide a flexible and powerful way to organize, manage, and track your AWS resources. By using tags effectively, you can improve resource management, cost allocation, and overall operational efficiency within your AWS environment.

Q: Route 53

Amazon Route 53 is a reliable and scalable DNS service that provides global coverage, advanced routing capabilities, and seamless integration with other AWS services. It is commonly used to manage DNS for domain registration, routing traffic to AWS resources, and improving the availability and performance of internet applications.

Q: aws cli vs aws sdk
A: AWS CLI:
The AWS CLI is a unified tool that provides a consistent interface for interacting with all parts of AWS.
It's a command-line tool for managing AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
It's primarily used for administrative tasks, such as managing resources in AWS, deploying applications, and automating manual tasks.
It's ideal for scripting, automation, and for those who prefer a command-line interface.
It's written in Python and can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
To connect to AWS via the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), you need to install the CLI and configure it with your AWS credentials. Here are the steps:
Step 1: Install AWS CLI
The AWS CLI is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The installation depends on your operating system. Here's how to install it on each:
Windows: Download the installer from the AWS CLI website and run it.
macOS and Linux: You can install the AWS CLI using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Run the following command:
pip install awscli --upgrade --user
Step 2: Configure AWS CLI
After installing the AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. You can do this by running the aws configure command:
aws configure
You'll be prompted to enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format. Here's what each of these means:
AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key: These are your AWS credentials, which you can get from the AWS Management Console. If you don't have these, you'll need to create a new IAM user with programmatic access, and AWS will generate a new set of keys for you.
Default region name: This is the name of the AWS region that you want to send your requests to by default. You can find a list of available regions in the AWS documentation.
Default output format: This specifies how the results are formatted. The options are json, yaml, text, and table. If you're not sure which one to choose, json is a good default.
After you've entered these details, your AWS CLI is set up and ready to use. You can start running commands to interact with AWS services. For example, to list all your S3 buckets, you can run:
aws s3 ls
AWS SDK:
AWS SDKs are language-specific APIs for AWS services. They are available in several programming languages such as Java, .NET, Node.js, Python (boto3), Go, Ruby, PHP, etc.
They are used to build applications with increased flexibility, reliability, and scalability.
They provide native features and take the complexity out of coding by providing AWS service-specific APIs.
They are ideal for developers building applications that use AWS services.
They handle low-level details such as authentication, retry logic, and error handling.
In summary, if you're a developer building an application that interacts with AWS services, you'd typically use the AWS SDK. If you're an administrator or DevOps engineer who needs to manage AWS resources, automate tasks, or quickly prototype something, you'd typically use the AWS CLI.
AWS SDKs are language-specific APIs for AWS services. They simplify the process of integrating your application, library, or script with AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, etc. AWS SDKs handle low-level details such as authentication, retry logic, and error handling.
To use an AWS SDK:
Choose the SDK that corresponds to the language you're using. AWS provides SDKs for several programming languages including Python (Boto3), JavaScript, Java, .NET, PHP, Go, Ruby, etc. aws.amazon.com, aws.amazon.com, aws.amazon.com.
Install the SDK. For example, to install Boto3 for Python, you can use pip:
pip install boto3
Configure your credentials. You can do this by setting your AWS access key ID and secret access key as environment variables:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
In your code, import the AWS SDK and use it to interact with AWS services. Here's a simple example using Boto3 to list all your S3 buckets:
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)

Q: ECS & Lambda
A: ECS and Lambda are two different services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for different purposes:
Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):
ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers.
With ECS, you can easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It provides features like automatic scaling, load balancing, service discovery, and integration with other AWS services.
ECS is suitable for running long-running applications, microservices architectures, and batch processing workloads in containers.
AWS Lambda:
Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It enables you to execute code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket, updates to a DynamoDB table, or HTTP requests through API Gateway.
With Lambda, you can write your code in various programming languages (such as Python, Node.js, Java, etc.) and upload it as a function. Lambda automatically scales your code in response to incoming requests, and you only pay for the compute time consumed by your code.
Lambda is suitable for event-driven, short-lived functions that require rapid scaling and pay-per-use pricing. It is commonly used for building serverless applications, event processing, data transformations, and backend services.
In summary, ECS is a container orchestration service for managing Docker containers, while Lambda is a serverless computing service for executing code in response to events. Both services offer different capabilities and are used for different use cases within the AWS ecosystem.

Q: Docker containers
A: Docker containers are lightweight, isolated, and portable environments that package an application and its dependencies into a single unit. Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Here are some key points about Docker containers:
Containerization:
Isolation: Docker containers provide process-level isolation, allowing applications to run in their own isolated environments without interfering with each other.
Portability: Containers are portable and can run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure.
Resource Efficiency: Containers share the host system's kernel, which makes them lightweight and efficient in terms of resource utilization.
Docker Components:
Docker Engine: The Docker Engine is the runtime that runs and manages containers. It includes the Docker daemon, which runs on the host system, and the Docker client, which allows users to interact with the Docker daemon through the command-line interface (CLI) or API.
Docker Images: Docker images are read-only templates that contain the application code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies required to run an application. Images are used to create containers.
Docker Containers: Containers are instances of Docker images that are running as isolated processes on a host system. Each container has its own filesystem, network, and process space.
Benefits of Docker Containers:
Consistency: Docker containers ensure consistency between development, testing, and production environments, reducing the chances of "it works on my machine" issues.
Scalability: Containers can be easily scaled up or down to meet the demands of the application, allowing for efficient resource utilization.
Rapid Deployment: Docker containers enable fast and automated deployment of applications, reducing the time and effort required for deployment.
Version Control: Docker images can be versioned, allowing you to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.
Dependency Management: Docker containers encapsulate dependencies, making it easier to manage and update software libraries and components.
Docker Ecosystem:
Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a public registry that hosts thousands of pre-built Docker images that can be used as a base for your own containers.
Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application in a single YAML file.
Docker Swarm and Kubernetes: Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are container orchestration platforms that allow you to manage and scale containerized applications across multiple hosts or clusters.
Docker containers have revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed. They provide a consistent and efficient way to package and run applications, making it easier to build and deploy software in a scalable and portable manner.
Docker containers have revolutionized the way applications are developed for several reasons:
Consistency: Docker containers provide a consistent environment for applications across different stages of the development lifecycle, including development, testing, and production. Developers can package their applications along with all the required dependencies, libraries, and configurations into a container. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, reducing the chances of "it works on my machine" issues.
Portability: Docker containers are highly portable and can run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure. This portability allows developers to build applications once and run them anywhere, making it easier to deploy applications across different environments, such as local development machines, on-premises servers, or cloud platforms.
Scalability: Docker containers enable easy scaling of applications. Containers can be quickly replicated and deployed across multiple hosts or clusters, allowing applications to handle increased traffic or workload demands. Docker's container orchestration platforms like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes provide automated scaling capabilities, making it easier to manage and scale containerized applications.
Rapid Deployment: Docker containers enable fast and automated deployment of applications. Containers can be created, started, stopped, and restarted quickly, reducing the time and effort required for application deployment. Docker also provides tools like Docker Compose, which allows developers to define and manage multi-container applications using a simple YAML file.
Dependency Management: Docker containers encapsulate dependencies, making it easier to manage and update software libraries and components. Developers can define the required dependencies in the container image, ensuring that the application runs with the correct versions of libraries and components. This eliminates conflicts between different applications or versions of dependencies and simplifies the process of managing dependencies.
Collaboration and Reproducibility: Docker containers facilitate collaboration among developers by providing a standardized and reproducible environment. Developers can share container images, allowing others to run the application in the same environment with the same dependencies. This makes it easier to reproduce and debug issues, as everyone is working with the same application environment.
Overall, Docker containers have revolutionized application development by providing a consistent, portable, scalable, and efficient way to package, deploy, and manage applications. They have simplified the development process, improved collaboration, and made it easier to build and deploy software in a scalable and portable manner.

Q: Do i need the same underlying OS when running a docker images?
A: No, you do not need the same underlying operating system (OS) when running a Docker image across multiple environments. One of the key advantages of Docker is its ability to provide application portability across different operating systems.
Docker achieves this through containerization, which isolates the application and its dependencies from the underlying host system. When you create a Docker image, it contains everything needed to run the application, including the application code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies. This allows the Docker image to be run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying OS.
Docker achieves OS compatibility by leveraging containerization technologies like namespaces and control groups, which provide process-level isolation and resource management. The Docker Engine, which runs and manages containers, interacts with the host OS kernel to provide a consistent and isolated environment for the application within the container.
However, it's important to note that while Docker provides cross-platform compatibility, there may still be some limitations or considerations to keep in mind:
Architecture Compatibility: Docker images are platform-specific, meaning that an image built for one architecture (e.g., x86) may not run on a different architecture (e.g., ARM). You need to ensure that the Docker image is built for the target architecture.
OS-Specific Dependencies: If your application has OS-specific dependencies, you may need to handle them differently for different host systems. For example, if your application relies on a specific library that is only available on certain OS distributions, you may need to modify your Docker image or use different base images for different environments.
Compatibility Testing: While Docker provides portability, it's still important to test your application on different environments to ensure compatibility and identify any potential issues that may arise due to differences in the underlying OS or system configurations.
In summary, Docker allows you to run the same Docker image across multiple environments, regardless of the underlying OS. However, it's important to consider architecture compatibility, OS-specific dependencies, and perform compatibility testing to ensure smooth operation across different environments.
